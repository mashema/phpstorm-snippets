Templates for PHPStorm IDE
==========================

These are some common Snippets, I use in PHPStorm IDE.  I'm trying to make collect useful snippets for CodeIgniter,
Wordpress, CI-Bonfire, and any other large application or useful snippet.

As this library grows more instructions will be added.  Please submit your pull-request if you have one and I will
test it and try to merge it in.

Installation
============

Put *.xml files into config/templates folder of you PHPStorm configuration.
For detailed informations visit [PHPStorm Live Template Web Help page.](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/webhelp/live-templates.html)

**MacOS**

The template folder can be found here: *~/Library/Preferences/WebIDE10/templates*

**Linux**

The template folder can be found here: *~/.WebIde10/config/templates*

You may have to replace WebIde10 with WebIdeXX where XX is your version number, V3 would be WebIde30 or V4 would be
WebIDE40, etc.  hope that makes sense.
